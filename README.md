This project seems needless on Firefox 60 and later.
You just go to `about:config` and turn `browser.urlbar.openintab` to `true`.
See also [the bug 1394304 - Support always open urlbar result in a new tab](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1394304).
(For the web search bar, you need to set `browser.search.openintab` to `true` also.)
